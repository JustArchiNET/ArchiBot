ArchiBoT (AIML brain)
====================

ArchiBoT's AI is based on open-sourced **[Rosie](https://github.com/pandorabots/rosie)** AIML files, with extra modifications.

---

Every user is welcome to contribute to ArchiBoT's AI, in order to do so:
- Create **[new file](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiBoT/new/master/AIML/lib/aiml)**
- Name it using your selected unique identifier, prefix with ```_``` and use ```.aiml``` extension, such as ```_bob.aiml```
- Put default AIML content:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<aiml>
</aiml>
```

- Fill the body of ```<aiml>``` however you want.

ArchiBoT's AI includes support for AIML 1.1 and AIML 2.0 language. For new contributions, I strongly encourage to use 2.0 syntax, which is fully documented **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wNT25hJRyupcG51aO89UcQEiG-HkXRXusukADpFnDs4/pub)**. You can also find extra documentation, including the one for AIML 1.1 **[here](http://www.alicebot.org/documentation/)**.

However, AIML is really easy, and you can base your work on already available **[examples](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiBoT/tree/master/AIML/lib/aiml)**. Simply select the one you like for an overview how AIML looks like.

While easy, it can also become complex and allow to implement variety of custom logic ranging from simple mini-games, through handling a conversation in given topic, to actual semi-learning module. Everything depends on what modifications you'd like to see.

Have you created your file already in the past and got approved? Great, it's even easier to update it!

- Open **[your file](https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiBoT/edit/master/AIML/lib/aiml/_blacksheep.aiml)** in edit mode
- Modify it the way you want
- You can also modify files you don't own, but the owner of the file will be asked for permission (if applicable)

- When done, commit your changes and wait for approval :+1:
