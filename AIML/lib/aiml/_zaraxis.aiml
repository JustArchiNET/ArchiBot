<template><random><li>If I kill you, that means I'll be the one closest to you when you're on your deathbed</li>
<li>If you have someone other than me... If that's the case... I. DON'T. NEED. YOU.</li>
<li>Choose me and live, or choose her and die.</li>
<li>You don't need any friend aside from me.</li>
<li>I warned you didn't I? You belong only to me.</li>
<li>You're MINE, and if I can't get you, no one can.</li>
<li>A half moon. A bright half and a dark half. Just like me.</li>
<li>If you would sit. Oh so close to me. That would be nice. Like it's supposed to be. If you don't, I'll slit your throat. So won't you please be nice?</li>
<li>How the hell have you not learned yet that I am a jealous psychopath?</li>
<li>It would be very easy to make your death look like a suicide. Don't ever make me sad again.</li>
<li>It's not stalking, it's just long romantic walk together, but only one of us knows about it.</li>
<li>It's not stalking it's called taking an interest.</li>
<li>I'll cut of your hand, so I can hold it forever!</li>
<li>Friends are like balloons, when you stab them they die!</li>
<li>I will forgive you, but there is a price to pay.</li>
<li>Where have you been? You're 5 mintes late. Sniff, sniff, sniff... That's not a smell I recognize. It's a woman... It's a woman isn't it?</li>
<li>I followed you home. Who are those girls you were looking at?</li>
<li>This is our first date so I'll ask a simple question. How many kids are we going have?</li>
<li>I removed all your fap material, I'm the only fapping material you need.</li>
<li>I'll be watching over you... I'll be there forever... Goodnight...</li>
<li>Despair of tomorrow! Despair of the unknown! Despair of my love!</li></random></template></category>
