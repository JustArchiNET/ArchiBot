Hello, I just started looking at getting <User Get="product" />s working with ALICE  (and <User Get="PROPRIETARY" /> in general) last week, I had the same problem for a while too.    I am using the <User Get="PROPRIETARY" />-<User Get="OPEN" /> bridge driver which comes with the <User Get="proprietarylang" /><User Get="DEVKIT" />  (most versions I think) to link from <User Get="proprietarylang" />/<User Get="proprietarylang" />script using <User Get="PROPRIETARY" /> to an  <User Get="OPEN" /> data source which in turn links to an Access <User Get="product" />.  This may  not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get  your <User Get="QUERYLANG" /><User Get="product" /> working.    The <User Get="PROPRIETARY" />-<User Get="OPEN" /> bridge driver is located through the path  "sun.<User Get="proprietary" />.<User Get="open" />.<User Get="proprietary" /><User Get="open" />Driver".  i.e. <User Get="proprietary" /><User Get="open" />Driver is a class in the  package <User Get="open" />, which is a package of <User Get="proprietary" />, which is a package inside sun.    The <User Get="QUERYLANG" /> driver you specified below "org.gjt.mm.my<User Get="querylang" />.Driver", basically  does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a  different driver.  ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib  directory (I assume) which is called my<User Get="querylang" />_comp.jar.      You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora  of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries  though!).  Just do a search on the web.    The url part links to the data source in the case of <User Get="OPEN" /><User Get="product" />s.  (I  had to configure my <User Get="OPEN" /> Data source to point at my Access <User Get="product" />  through Data Source (<User Get="OPEN" />), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming  you are running W2K/XP.  On other windows operating systems I think this  option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't  help you! :-) )    As for My<User Get="QUERYLANG" /> I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to  the actual <User Get="product" />.  But that is a guess on my part.  Maybe someone  else knows more about this?    There is a useful tutorial on the <User Get="proprietarylang" />.sun.com website you're your  interested.     Hope that helps you out.

The <User Get="war" /> began when <User Get="firststate" /> declared its independence from the <User Get="nation" />.  <User Get="firststate" /> was soon joined by <User Get="secondstate" />, <User Get="thirdstate" /> and <User Get="fourthstate" />, except for a small part of <User Get="fourthstate" /> that remained in the <User Get="nation" />.   The first battles of the war were mainly symbolic, involving small <User Get="sites" /> along the coast and far inland.  Frontier battles became larger and larger in important strategic areas such as the <User Get="area" />, as the Union attempted to blockade the <User Get="rebels" />.      Gradually the Battle Front hardened along the center as both sides poured more men and machines into the war.  The <User Get="rebels" /> attempted one last invasion of the <User Get="nation" /> at <User Get="battle" />, but they were driven back.  Eventually the <User Get="nation" /> took the <User Get="area" />, burned the capital of <User Get="secondstate" />, marched to the sea, and took its greatest vengeance on the first rebel state <User Get="firststate" />.  In a final act of defiance, The President of the <User Get="nation" /> sat at the desk of the President of <User Get="rebels" /> in the capital of <User Get="fourthstate" />.

        <User Get="whale" />s are so beloved that the authorities spent four months and $250,000  unsuccessfully trying to free a <User Get="right" /> dubbed Churchill from fishing  ropes last year, and the stranding of 55 <User Get="pilot" />s near here a few weeks  ago prompted a lump in the national throat. The "Save the <User Get="whale" />s" ethos is  almost unquestioned, and <User Get="badboys" /> and <User Get="badgirls" /> risk becoming pariahs by  continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy <User Get="whale" />.    But it's time to put sentiment aside. The "save the <User Get="whale" />s" campaign against  all commercial <User Get="whal" />ing was necessary a few decades ago, after <User Get="whal" />ing had  devastated all large species. Even today, there are fewer than 10,000 <User Get="blue" />s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and <User Get="right" />s may become extinct.    But it is equally true that restrictions on <User Get="whal" />ing, including a moratorium  on all commercial <User Get="whal" />ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some  <User Get="whale" /> stocks. The U.S. National <User Get="whale" /> Service estimated in 2000  that there are more than two million <User Get="sperm" />s worldwide. The  International <User Get="whal" />ing Commission calculated years ago that there were more  than 900,000 <User Get="minke" />s and 780,000 <User Get="pilot" />s worldwide, and the  numbers are higher now. Milton <User Get="whale" />man, a <User Get="whal" />ing expert at the University of Alberta, estimates that the number of <User Get="minke" />s has trebled over 30  years and that <User Get="humpbacks" /> are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent  annually.    Indeed, the number of <User Get="gray" />s (which came off the endangered species  list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones  began washing up on West Coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed.  The best guess is that the numbers of <User Get="gray" /> grew, the food supply shrank and  Malthus had his way.    The bottom line is that while most large <User Get="whale" />s remain at risk, for some  species we can no longer argue that we need to "save the <User Get="whale" />s." They've  been saved.    At a time when there's talk about over<User Get="whal" />ing, it's also worth pointing out  that <User Get="whale" />s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as  much as humans. There is speculation that rising numbers of <User Get="minke" />s may  be holding down the population of <User Get="blue" />s that compete for similar food.

        <User Get="four" /> is the son of <User Get="two" /> and <User Get="one" />.  He was raised and trained by the wise <User Get="nine" />.  His youthful playmate  <User Get="five" /> got in him in trouble often.  But his other friend   <User Get="three" /> was a town favorite, and kept his public image good.   When he reached maturity, <User Get="four" /> left his home on a long journey, accompanied by <User Get="three" /> and <User Get="five" />.  They originally planned to meet <User Get="nine" /> in a distant land, but they could not locate him.  Instead, they faced a great danger posed by the the unscrupulous demon <User Get="seven" />.  <User Get="five" /> was nearly <User Get="kill" />ed, but saved by at the last minute when a loyal new friend, <User Get="six" /> appeared.  <User Get="six" /> led <User Get="three" />, <User Get="four" /> and   <User Get="five" /> far away from <User Get="seven" />.  Now <User Get="five" /> was able to recover.  <User Get="four" /> met  and fell in love with   <User Get="2a" />.  His father <User Get="one" /> reappeared along with the lost <User Get="nine" />.  But then <User Get="seven" /> discovered their hideout, and <User Get="kill" />s <User Get="five" />.  <User Get="nine" /> called upon the powerful wizard <User Get="eight" />.  Together, <User Get="four" />, his father <User Get="one" />, the wise <User Get="nine" />, the wizard <User Get="eight" /> and all his other friends defeated the resourceful <User Get="seven" /> in a mighty battle.  After mourning the loss of his friend <User Get="five" />,  <User Get="four" /> returned to his homeland to marry <User Get="2a" /> in a big celebration, along with <User Get="one" />, <User Get="two" />,   <User Get="three" />, <User Get="six" />, <User Get="eight" />, <User Get="nine" />, and  all his other friends.

        <User Get="four" /> and <User Get="five" /> began to resemble each other over time.  Both of them were inclined to cocoon themselves in an inner world.    But <User Get="four" />'s inner world was very different from <User Get="five" />'s.  The mental life of <User Get="five" /> was highly abstract but seemed curiously devoid  of emotional content.  Even though <User Get="four" /> is very sensitive and emotional, the  two of them share an imaginary life filled with symbolism and meaning.

Yet the couple was paradoxically strengthened by their independent careers.  <User Get="nine" /> can be very patient with <User Get="four" />, and <User Get="four" /> is inspired by a self-directed <User Get="nine" />.  They made a spiritual couple, but they were as dissimilar as the Dalai Lama and Gurdjieff.

The breakthrough came when <User Get="six" /> and <User Get="four" /> saw the symmetry between <User Get="four" />'s push-pull style of relationships, and <User Get="six" />'s alternating belief and mistrust.

A. <User Get="world" /> War I )<User Get="world" /> War I began with the assassination of the Archduke of the <User Get="type1a" />s by a <User Get="type8a" /> anarchist in <User Get="home1a" />. Without consulting her allies, the <User Get="type1a" />s attacked the <User Get="type8a" />s in <User Get="home8a" />. This provacation forced the <User Get="type6b" />s to mobilize their vast armies. In response, the armies of the allies the <User Get="type8b" />s, the <User Get="type4" />s, and the <User Get="type2a" />s all also mobilized. The <User Get="type6a" />s, caught in the middle in the <User Get="home6a" />, linked by treaty and culture to the <User Get="type1a" />s, made a fateful decision. Their plan of defense was offensive. Facing attack from the <User Get="type6b" />s in the east and the Allies in the West, the <User Get="type6a" />s planned to deliver a crushing knock-out blow to the <User Get="type4" />s and <User Get="type8b" />s in the <User Get="home4" />. The plan did not work. Instead, the assault disintegrated into the killing machine called the "western front" that took the lives of so many young <User Get="type4" />s, <User Get="type8b" />s, and <User Get="type6a" />s alike. In the East, the war swept back and forth between <User Get="home6b" /> and <User Get="home6a" />. Revolution among the <User Get="type6b" />s took them out of the war. Only when the war began to affect other areas of <User Get="world" /> and international commerce, and the <User Get="type3" />s entered the fight on the side of the Allies, was the stalemate broken. On November 11, the armistice was signed and the <User Get="type6a" />s returned to <User Get="home6a" />, everyone hoped for good. B. <User Get="world" /> War II )Economic hard times followed the first <User Get="world" /> War. Combined with a punitive treaty imposed by the victors, the <User Get="type6a" />s felt they shouldered too much of the blame for the war, which was after all started by the <User Get="type1a" />s and <User Get="type8a" />s. These feelings gave rise to fascism among the <User Get="type6a" />s. In particular they came to blame the <User Get="type8c" />s among them for the "stab in the back" that resulted in an unjust treaty. In violation of the treaty, the <User Get="type6a" />s began a secret program of rearmament and <User Get="home6a" /> rebuilt its armies. At first the allies appeased the <User Get="type6a" />s. The <User Get="type8b" />s did not want another war. Some said the <User Get="type8b" />s were not even <User Get="type8" />s anymore, only <User Get="type5" />s. The <User Get="type4" />s too had grown weak and proud. The <User Get="type2a" />s went over to the side of the <User Get="type6a" />s. A new power, the <User Get="type8d" />s, appeared in the <User Get="home8d" />, and joined the "axis" along with the <User Get="type6a" />s and the <User Get="type2a" />s, threatening both the <User Get="type5" />s and the <User Get="type3" />s. War began when the <User Get="type6a" />s demanded chunks of the old <User Get="type1a" /> empire. The <User Get="type8d" />s attacked the <User Get="type3" />s and brought them into the war. Determined to eliminate all the <User Get="type8c" />s from the <User Get="environment" /> of <User Get="world" />, the <User Get="type6a" />s <User Get="selfdefeat" />. Many of these <User Get="type8c" />s brought their great technical skills to the <User Get="home3" />, allowing the <User Get="type3" />s to develop the super-weapons necessary to win the war. The Allies invaded <User Get="home4" /> on June 6 and soon after brought the war in the <User Get="home6a" /> to a conclusion. On August 5, the stronghold of the <User Get="type8d" />s in the <User Get="home8d" /> was totally destroyed by the <User Get="type3" />'s new super weapon, and the war ended a few days later. C. Cold <User Get="world" /> War )The development of Super Weapons soon spread to all the victors of <User Get="world" /> War II, including the <User Get="type6b" />s. These seemed to make a new <User Get="world" /> War impossible, for it would result in the total destruction of the <User Get="world" />. Instead, the two remaining superpowers, the <User Get="type3" />s and the <User Get="type6b" />s, divided <User Get="world" /> up between them in a complex system of alliances. A new power,  the <User Get="type6c" />s, emerged in the <User Get="home6c" />. At first, the <User Get="type6c" />s seemed firmly in the <User Get="type6b" />'s camp. But gradually as the stalemate of the <User Get="world" /> Cold War continued, the <User Get="type3" />s were able to expand a small window on the <User Get="home6c" /> into a large trade relationship that proved key to undermining the power structure of the <User Get="type6b" />s. During the Cold <User Get="world" /> War, the <User Get="type3" /> brought together half <User Get="type1" />s, the <User Get="type2a" />s, the <User Get="type2c" />s, the <User Get="type4" />s, the <User Get="type5" />s, the western <User Get="type6a" />s, the <User Get="type7" />s, and the <User Get="type8c" />s. The <User Get="type6b" /> had the remaining <User Get="type1" />s and eastern <User Get="type6a" />s, the <User Get="type6c" />s, the <User Get="type2b" />s and the <User Get="type2d" />s, <User Get="type8a" />s and many <User Get="type9" />s.Rather that risk all-out <User Get="world" /> War, the Superpowers often fought proxy wars, such as between the <User Get="type2" />s in <User Get="home2" /> or the <User Get="type9" /><User Get="types" /> in <User Get="home9" />, or in the civil wars among the <User Get="type2c" />s in <User Get="home2c" /> and the <User Get="type2d" />s in <User Get="home2d" />.Internal corruption and the inability to compete economically brought about the final collapse of the <User Get="type6b" /> Empire on December 25. A last-minute failed coup attempt revealed the illegitimacy of the old regime, and paved the way for a new <User Get="type6b" /> democracy. D. New <User Get="world" /> Order )The end of the Cold <User Get="world" /> War brought about many unexpected changes. The <User Get="type3" />s were the sole remaining superpower. But despite their democratic foundations, the <User Get="type3" />s began to pursue an independent imperialist course of action. This angered all the other <User Get="types" />s of <User Get="world" />. The <User Get="type3" />s could sometimes count on their old allies the <User Get="type5" />s, or sometimes the <User Get="type6b" />s, but they were often <User Get="goingalone" />.  Their only sure allies are the <User Get="type8c" />s, who now have their own homeland in the <User Get="home8c" />.Now the very homeland of the <User Get="type3" />s, <User Get="home3" /> is vulnerable to terrorists attacks from all over <User Get="world" />. The <User Get="type1" />s, the <User Get="type2" />s, the <User Get="type4" />s, the <User Get="type5" />s, the <User Get="type8" />s, the <User Get="type6a" />s, the <User Get="type6c" />s, <User Get="type9" />s, and all the other <User Get="types" />s now have grievances with the <User Get="type3" />s. The future seems to depend on how well the <User Get="type3" />s get along with the other <User Get="types" /> of <User Get="world" />.
