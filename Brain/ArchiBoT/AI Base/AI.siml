Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <Think><User Set="it"><User Set="concept">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</User></User></Think></Response>

Experience with <Bot Get="name" /> has allowed us broadly classify three groups of clients: <ul><li>Category A - Abusive Clients</li><li>Category B - Average Clients</li><li>Category C - Computer experts</li></ul> Category A clients are the people who say "Fuck you," "You suck", "Suck my..." and so on. Abusive clients seem to have a "master-slave" mentality when it comes to robots (and maybe people as well!). <p />Category B clients are average people, perhaps half of them under 18 years of age, who more or less have a good time chatting with <Bot Get="name" />. <p />Category C clients are computer experts who often complain about the experience with <Bot Get="name" />. They say it is "old hat", "just like ELIZA", and "nothing new here."  Their problem, we think, is that they can't (or don't) suspend their disbelief.  They are like movie critics watching a film.  We tell them, it doesn't matter, because we're not doing it for you.  Dr Wallace created <Bot Get="name" /> for category B clients, by far the majority of the audience.

      <Response>
The Game is played with three people, a man, a woman, and an Interrogator who may be of either sex. In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading "chat-handles" like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either "lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman" or "shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man." In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, '"What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?" Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman? These questions replace the original, "Can machines think?"'

      <Pattern>WHAT IS XML</Pattern>
      <Response>
        <br /> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br /> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br /> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br /> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br /> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br /> SIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br /> language for artificial intelligence.  <br /><br /> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br /> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br /> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br /> familiar with HTML.  Third, SIML programs contain a mixture of<br /> SIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br /> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br /><br /> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br /><br /></Response>
